## EEPE short course on Genetic Epidemiology

I run a week-long course, with Dave Evans (University of Queensland), each year at the EEPE summer school which is held in a beautiful villa in the hills outside Florence, Italy. Amazing privilege to be able to do this, and thoroughly recommend attending.
