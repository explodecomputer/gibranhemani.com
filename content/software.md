My personal github page: [https://github.com/explodecomputer](https://github.com/explodecomputer)

I also regularly contribute to the MRC IEU github organisation code base: [https://github.com/mrcieu/](https://github.com/mrcieu/)

## Causal inference

- [TwoSampleMR R package](https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/) - Methods for two-sample Mendelian randomization, along with data management and harmonisation functions

- [MR-Base web app](http://app.mrbase.org/) - Simple wrapper for the TwoSampleMR R package

- [MR-TRYX R package](https://explodecomputer.github.io/tryx/index.html) - Detecting novel pathways to disease by exploiting horizontal pleiotropy (TReasure Your eXceptions!)

## Genetics

- [OpenGWAS API](http://gwas-api.mrcieu.ac.uk/) - Rapidly query across hundreds of billions of genetic associations, and perform related LD-based operations such as clumping and identifying tagging variants

- [ieugwasr R package](https://mrcieu.github.io/ieugwasr/) - A simple R interface for convenient access to the OpenGWAS API

- [gwasvcf R package](https://mrcieu.github.io/gwasvcf/) - Rapidly query genetic associations in the [GWAS VCF file format](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.115824v1)

- [gwasglue R package](https://mrcieu.github.io/gwasglue/) - Connect data from GWAS VCF files or the OpenGWAS API to a range of analytical tools designed for GWAS summary data

- [GoDMC API](http://api.godmc.org.uk/v0.1) - Query the cis- and trans-mQTL results from the [GoDMC project](http://godmc.org.uk/)

- [random-METAL](https://github.com/explodecomputer/random-metal) - An edit to the popular software package [METAL](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/METAL). This edit enables a DerSimonian-Laird random effects meta-analysis model.

- [simulateGP](https://explodecomputer.github.io/simulateGP/) - R package that contains a collection of methods for simulating and analysing genotype-phenotype relationships

- [ImputePipe](https://github.com/explodecomputer/imputePipe) - Pipelines for performing imputation of genotyped datasets

- [gctaPower](https://shiny.cnsgenomics.com/gctaPower/) - Power calculator for univariate and bivariate genomic REML analyses

- [epiGPU](https://github.com/explodecomputer/epiGPU) - Perform exhaustive two-dimensional epistasis scans rapidly using GPU accelerators

- [epiCPU](https://github.com/explodecomputer/episcan) - Perform exhaustive two-dimensional epistasis scans rapidly across multiple CPU cores

- [epiPower web app](https://github.com/explodecomputer/epipower) - Calculate statistical power and significance thresholds for two-dimensional epistasis scans

## Epidemiology

- [ascRtain R package](https://github.com/explodecomputer/AscRtain) - Explore bias in observational associations due to collider issues that arise from non-random sampling

- [ALSPAC data dictionary](http://variables.alspac.bris.ac.uk/) - Browse all the phenotypic variables captured within the [Avon Longitudinal Study for Parents and Children](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/)


## Random stuff

- [USS Pension model](http://www.uss-pension-model.com/) - Collaboration with Neil Davies to illustrate the impact of the planned changes to the UK University pension scheme

- [Shared parental leave calculator](https://github.com/explodecomputer/shared-parental-leave) - How to divide up shared parental leave? This R package attempts to calculate the cost, time spent with baby and work time lost
