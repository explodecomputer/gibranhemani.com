I am an Associate Professor in Statistical Genetics at the University of Bristol. My academic interests are in genetics, computational methods, statistical methods for causal inference and decolonisation. I currently hold a Wellcome Trust Sir Henry Dale Fellowship, which focuses on leveraging large scale genetic data to improve causal inference in epidemiological models. I obtained a PhD in quantative genetics at the University of Edinburgh, UK, and then spent two years at the University of Queensland, Australia prior to coming to Bristol. 

I live with my wife and three astonishingly messy creatures (two small children, one dog) in Bristol, UK, and have been here since 2014. 

This site collates my publications, software, current projects and teaching materials. Do get in touch if you're interested in my work, have questions, or perhaps fancy a quick game of chess =]
