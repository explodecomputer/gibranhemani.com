I am a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Bristol with academic interests in genetics, computational methods, statistics and machine learning. I currently hold a Wellcome Trust Sir Henry Dale Fellowship, which focuses on leveraging large scale genetic data to improve causal inference in epidemiological models. I obtained a PhD in quantative genetics at the University of Edinburgh, UK, and then spent two years at the University of Queensland, Australia prior to coming to Bristol. 

I live with my wife and two astonishingly messy creatures (one toddler, one dog) in Bristol, UK, and have been here since 2014. 

This site collates my publications, software, current projects and teaching materials. Do get in touch if you're interested in my work, have questions, or perhaps fancy a quick game of chess =]
